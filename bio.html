            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, My name is Orrian Arnold and I am currently a senior studying computer science and
                Economics at Northwestern University. I enjoy using technology to find meaningful solutions
                to real-world issues, and to connect people around the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Career Experience</h2>
            <p>I have worked for both finance and tech companies to both expand my horizons as well 
                as understand the career I would like to pursue after college. I initially started by 
                working for a finance company in Chicago called <a href="https://www.williamblair.com/" target="_blank">William Blair</a>
                as an analyst, and from there I transitioned into a software developer for a water filtration company called 
                <a href="https://www.pentair.com/" target="_blank">Pentair</a>. From these roles I learned to be a well-rounded 
                and efficient worker.
            </p>
